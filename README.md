# NFT-Minter  


## Idea/Flow

- upload image from frontend
- upload the image to ipfs using pinata
- make json(put random info for now/ can be taken from user too) and upload it to ipfs using pinata
- now we can mint the nft 
- get back to user by some means on frontend

### phase 1

- Initially did it manually
by using one file then next and so on 

- made the market place manually although used some basic code to generate jsons automatically

- tried minting multiple nfts together but got a wierd error (yeah dint ask on unidao discord) (present in nft-collection folder)

- [nft collection](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/mynft-6577) -there are few blank and few repetetions but yeah i did it. 

### phase 2 
Make a basic front end 

### phase 3 
Integrate the frontend to automatically perform the above tasks 
(could not complete , somewhere in midway with errors)

### phase 4
Now we can include metamask in the process
